          <p>
            GuessEye was inspired by{' '}
            <ExternalLink href="https://trackmadle.gearfive.org">
              a conceptually similar guessing game for Trackmania players
            </ExternalLink>
            , which was further loosely inspired by Wordle. However, I wanted to
            take the concept to another level and make it focused on the game of
            darts I&apos;ve been playing on and off for more than 10 years and I
            really enjoy.
          </p>
          <p>
            I&apos;ve spent a <span className="italic">lot</span> of time adding
            darts players to the database and finding information about them, so
            my goal is to maintain the database as up-to-date as possible. For
            example, you can expect PDC/WDF ranking and Tour Card Holder
            information to be very accurate as I&apos;ve developed some tiny
            tools to automate updating it. You can also expect updated best
            results after the PDC/WDF World Championship and UK Open every year.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still, some information will, inevitably, be updated on a
            case-by-case basis (such as any changes to darts or status). See the
            Contact section below if you&apos;ve encountered any inaccurate
            information.
          </p>
          <p>
            GuessEye is and will continue to be{' '}
            <span className="font-medium">100% free and open-source</span> and
            you can find it on{' '}
            <ExternalLink href="https://github.com/dziubenzo/guesseye">
              GitHub

            . You can see it as a modest contribution to darts from a fan of the
            sport.
